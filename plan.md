# Task Management Database Implementation Plan

## Database Schema

### Tables

1. `users`
   - `user_id` (PRIMARY KEY)
   - `username`
   - `email`
   - `created_at`

2. `projects`
   - `project_id` (PRIMARY KEY)
   - `name`
   - `description`
   - `created_at`

3. `tasks`
   - `task_id` (PRIMARY KEY)
   - `title`
   - `description`
   - `status` (e.g., 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed')
   - `priority` (e.g., 'low', 'medium', 'high')
   - `due_date`
   - `created_at`
   - `project_id` (FOREIGN KEY)
   - `assigned_to` (FOREIGN KEY referencing users)
   - `created_by` (FOREIGN KEY referencing users)

4. `tags`
   - `tag_id` (PRIMARY KEY)
   - `name`
   - `created_by` (FOREIGN KEY referencing users)

5. `task_tags` (Junction table for tasks and tags)
   - `task_id` (FOREIGN KEY)
   - `tag_id` (FOREIGN KEY)

## Implementation Steps

1. Create Database Setup Script
   - Initialize SQLite database
   - Create all necessary tables with proper constraints
   - Add indexes for frequently queried columns

2. Create Basic CRUD Operations
   - Functions for managing users
   - Functions for managing projects
   - Functions for managing tasks
   - Functions for managing tags

3. Create Advanced Query Functions
   - Get tasks by project
   - Get tasks by user
   - Get tasks by tag
   - Get tasks by status
   - Get tasks by due date range
   - Get task statistics

## Technical Specifications

- Database: SQLite3
- Database file: tasks.db
- Constraints:
  - Cascade deletes for related records
  - Unique constraints for usernames and emails
  - Not null constraints for required fields
  - Default timestamps for created_at fields

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Task comments system
- Task attachments
- Task dependencies
- Recurring tasks
- Team/Group management
- Task history/audit log 

## MCP Server Implementation

1. Server Setup
   - Create FastAPI-based MCP server
   - Implement WebSocket connections for real-time communication
   - Set up LLM integration (OpenAI GPT)
   - Create database connection pool

2. Natural Language Processing Components
   - Intent recognition for common operations (add, search, delete, update)
   - Entity extraction (tasks, users, projects, dates, priorities)
   - Query translation to SQL
   - Response formatting

3. API Endpoints
   - WebSocket endpoint for natural language interactions
   - REST endpoints for direct operations
   - Authentication and session management

4. Database Operations Layer
   - Create database connection manager
   - Implement safe query execution
   - Transaction management
   - Error handling and recovery

5. Natural Language Commands Support
   - Task creation and assignment
   - Task search and filtering
   - Project management
   - Tag operations
   - User management
   - Status updates

6. Response Generation
   - Natural language response formatting
   - Error message generation
   - Confirmation messages
   - Interactive clarifications

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI for the web server
- OpenAI GPT for natural language processing
- SQLite3 for database
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- Pydantic for data validation
- SQLAlchemy for database operations
